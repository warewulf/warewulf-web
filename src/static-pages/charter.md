title: Warewulf Project Charter
---

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for
technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Warewulf open source
project (the “Project”). All contributors (including committers,
maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in
the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms
of this Charter.

## 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

1. The mission of the Project is to maintain and enhance the source
   code of the Warewulf open source container platform.

2. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under
   the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission,
   including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of
   other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or
   adoption of the open source project.

## 2. Technical Steering Committee

1. The Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC") will be responsible
   for all technical oversight of the open source Project.

2. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will
   be as set forth within the "CONTRIBUTING" file within the Project's
   code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for
   determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative
   approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings
   of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the
   public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or
   in person.

3. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and
   Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles
   are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise
   documented:

   1. Contributors include anyone in the technical community that
      contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to
      the Project.

   2. Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to
      modify ("commit") source code, documentation or other technical
      artifacts in a project's repository; and

   3. A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of
      the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a
      majority approval of the other existing Committers.

4. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and
   Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of
   this Charter.

5. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission,
   approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements
   for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as
   applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the
   roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and
   publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

6. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of
   the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by
   the TSC.

7. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of
   oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

   1. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;

   2. approving project or system proposals (including, but not
      limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a
      sub-project's scope);

   3. organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;

   4. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on
      cross-project technical issues and requirements;

   5. appointing representatives to work with other open source or
      open standards communities;

   6. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and
      security reporting policies;

   7. approving and implementing policies and processes for
      contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and
      resolving matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in
      Section 6 of this Charter;

   8. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on
      technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple
      projects; and

   9. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding
      the Project.

## 3. TSC Voting

1. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community,
   if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward,
   the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting
   member basis.

2. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all
   voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to
   meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any
   decisions at the meeting.

3. Except as provided in Section 6.3. and 7.1., decisions by vote at a
   meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided
   quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting
   require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC.

## 4. Compliance with Policies

1. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, the
   Project will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on
   its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect.

2. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual
   or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under
   this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the
   TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the
   Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on
   any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are
   reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all
   Collaborators in the Project community.

3. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and
   ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions,
   proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and
   easily visible to all.

## 5. General Rules and Operations

1. The Project will:

   1. engage in the work of the Project in a professional manner
      consistent with maintaining a cohesive community; and

   2. respect the rights of all trademark owners, including any
      branding and trademark usage guidelines.

## 6. Intellectual Property Policy

1. Collaborators acknowledge that the copyright in all new
   contributions will be retained by the copyright holder as
   independent works of authorship and that no contributor or
   copyright holder will be required to assign copyright to the
   Project.

2. Except as described in Section 6.3., all contributions to the
   Project are subject to the following:

   1. All new inbound code contributions to the Project must be made
      using the 3-clause BSD License (the "Project License").

   2. All new inbound code contributions must also be accompanied by a
      Developer Certificate of Origin
      (http://developercertificate.org) sign-off in the source code
      system that is submitted through a TSC-approved contribution
      process which will bind the authorized contributor and, if not
      self-employed, their employer to the applicable license;

   3. All outbound code will be made available under the Project
      License.

   4. Documentation will be received and made available by the Project
      under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License
      (available at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

   5. To the extent a contribution includes or consists of data, any
      rights in such data shall be made available under the
      CDLA-Permissive 2.0 License, available at
      https://cdla.dev/permissive-2.0.

   6. The Project may seek to integrate and contribute back to other
      open source projects ("Upstream Projects"). In such cases, the
      Project will conform to all license requirements of the Upstream
      Projects, including dependencies, leveraged by the
      Project. Upstream Project code contributions not stored within
      the Project's main code repository will comply with the
      contribution process and license terms for the applicable
      Upstream Project.

3. The TSC may approve the use of an alternative license or licenses
   for inbound or outbound contributions on an exception basis. To
   request an exception, please describe the contribution, the
   alternative open source license(s), and the justification for using
   an alternative open source license for the Project. License
   exceptions must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the entire TSC.

4. Contributed files should contain license information, such as SPDX
   short form identifiers, indicating the open source license or
   licenses pertaining to the file.

## 7. Amendments

1. This charter may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the entire TSC.
